# Welcome to my portfolio!

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.
I used Tailwind CSS for styling, resulting in a fully responsive website.
A live version of this app can be found here.
Local development

Clone this repository on your machine.

```

$ cd portfolio

$ npm install

$ npm start

```

The app will then be available at http://localhost:3000 in your browser.
